  De La Soul is one of the most lyrical hip hop bands that's been around since the early 90's. I was fortunate enought to see them live in part of job that consisted of me attending concerts.

  I first heard the venezuelan band in 2010 in one of their performances at the Logan Square Auditorium. I fell in love with their music then, what they call <em>gozadera</em>, we consider funk music. Their lively performances will have you appreciate their whole discography!
