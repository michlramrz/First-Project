  <h1> My Top Five Concerts</h1>
  <h3> In my time working for the newspaper, I was able to do some freelance writing and photography and it came with its perks! I was able to see a lot of my favorite artists live and learn of some new ones!</h3>
  <h2>#5 Lila Downs</h2>

  <p>
   Lila Downs, her homemade costumes and amazing vocals are well worth any show and movie soundtrack.

  <h2>#4. Daddy Yankee</h2>

  <p>
   I'm not a fan of Reggeaton music but I have to admit that Daddy Yankee put up a great show and is great at pumping up his audience.
  <h2>#3. Natalia Lafourcade</h2>

  <p>
   Natalia Lafourcade is a very talented singer/songwriter, producer and actress. Her music is very pop-like and enjoyable.

  <h2>#2. De La Soul</h2>

  <p>
   De La Soul is one of the best lyrical hip hop bands that's been around since the early 90's. I was fortunate enought to see them live, in part of a former job that consisted of me attending concerts.

  <h2>#1. Los Amigos Invisibles</h2>

  <p>
   I first heard the venezuelan band in 2010 in one of their performances at the Logan Square Auditorium. I fell in love with their music then, what they call "gozadera", we consider funk music. Their lively performances will have you appreciate their whole discography!
